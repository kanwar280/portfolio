hello visitor,
As i am writing this about me file, i wonder what might be your intention towards opening this file.
Well anyways this file is named "about.txt", i have to tell you something about myself, promise won't make anything up :p.


I consider myself as an artist and also an engineer on the side. I graduated with a major in Computer Science in 2022,
and ever since been working as programmer analyst trainee. I've enjoyed working from home a little too much that's why i decided to create this portfolio website.
\\there is no particular reason why i made this portfolio, it just seemed cool. Also i copied some ideas from people i admire.

Thanks for visiting.
do visit again to see some updates in future maybe :)
